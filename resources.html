        <h2>Social and Environmental Triggers:</h2>
        <p>
            The risk of depression is greatly influenced by external factors.   Vulnerability is increased by trauma, abuse, and negative experiences in childhood. Social isolation and loneliness are also powerful predictors. Depressive symptoms are made worse by financial difficulties, and poverty is associated with long-term stress. The necessity of thorough treatments addressing environmental stressors is highlighted by these social determinants.

        <h2>Depression in Different Age Groups:</h2>
        <p>
            Different age groups experience depression in different ways. Instead of sadness, it can manifest in youngsters as irritation. Teenagers frequently suffer from depression brought on by social media and academic pressure. While older people deal with silence and deteriorating health, adults deal with relationship and work-related pressures. Age-appropriate diagnosis and treatment are ensured by acknowledging these differences.

      <section id="Block3" class="Animation">
        <h2>Gender Differences:</h2>
        <p>
            Due to hormonal changes, social influences, and an increased desire to seek care, women are twice as likely as males to receive a diagnosis of depression. However, instead of displaying visible sadness, men may display hostility, substance abuse, or risk-taking. These variations imply that gender-sensitive methods of mental health treatment are required.

      <section id="Block4" class = "Animation">
        <h2>Depression and Physical Health:</h2>
        <p>
            Depression and physical health are closely linked. Depression symptoms are worsened by ongoing illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. Depression is associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP). The illness is made worse by sleep problems. Combined medical techniques are necessary because of this reciprocal link. 
        </p>

      <section id="Block5" class="Animation">
        <h2>Cultural Perspectives:</h2>
        <p>
            Depression treatment and expression are influenced by cultural ideas. While some non-Western cultures consider depression to be spiritual or biological, Western society frequently medicalise illness. In many places, stigma still prevents people from getting care. Effective care requires culturally appropriate mental health services. 
        </p>

      <section id="Block6" class="Animation">
        <h2>Treatment Options:</h2>
        <p>
            Medication, psychotherapy, and new therapies are all effective treatments. Interpersonal therapy (IPT) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have strong support. It is usual practice to give antidepressants. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and ketamine have shown potential for treating patients that are resistant to treatment. Sports and other lifestyle changes also promote healing.
