        <h2>Biological Causes of Depression:</h2>
        <p>
            Research has shown that a personâ€™s biological makeup has a great contribution to depression. Depression is genetic and can be passed down from parent to child, this can be seen in studies done on twins which showed a heritability rate of 30-40%. <br>
            Abnormalities in the brainâ€™s neurotransmitters can also cause depression. Serotonin, Dopamine and Norepinephrine are some chemicals in the brain that affects things like mood. The neurotransmitters in the brain are responsible for releasing these hormones and abnormalities in these neurotransmitters affects the way and amount of these hormones getting released. The imbalance of these hormones can cause depression as well as other mental disorders. <br>
            Hormones like cortisol can exacerbate the symptoms of depression if levels are to high, due to chronic stress.

        <h2>Psychological Theories:</h2>
        <p>
            Psychological theories provide clarity on the emotional and cognitive processes causing depression. Depression can be triggered by distorted thinking and negative self-schemas. Hopelessness appears to be caused by a perceived loss of control. This can however be treated through Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).

        <h2>Severity of Symptoms:</h2>
        <p>
          The severity of certain symptoms and signs can significantly impact the type and intensity of the treatment. <br>
          The severity of depression is associated with several factors, namely:
          <ul>
            <li>Quality of life</li>
            <li>Functional impairment</li>
            <li>Suicidal thoughts and tendencies</li>
            <li>Longitudinal course</li>
            <li>Biological factors (as mentioned above)</li>
          </ul>
           The severity of depression has been a topic of controversy as it can be used to determine what types of treatments can be used as first line treatments. Most research on severity is based on scores on symptom scales, with a disregard for how to properly conceptualize the severity of the depression. The fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Associationâ€™s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) define the severity of only a select few disorders like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, most of these scales were developed without a clear system for understanding what makes depression mild, moderate, or severe. <br>
           The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental Disorders (DSM-5) states that there are three levels of severity for MDD. Mild severity includes only a few more symptoms than what is required to be diagnosed with MDD. Mild MDD still allows a person to function day to day, even if the person is struggling. Severe depression makes the person suffer intense distress and significantly imposes on daily life and the relationships of the person suffering from MDD. <br>
           The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) also classifies depression as mild, moderate and severe. However, they use more detail to determine which symptoms matter the most. They state that severe depression includes symptoms like deep feelings of guilt, hopelessness and suicidal thoughts and tendencies as being common among patients suffering from severe depression. <br>
           Different medical systems approach depression differently and this highlights why understanding the severity of a patientâ€™s depression is important for diagnosing and treating the patient.

        <h2>Stigma and Its Effects:</h2>
        <p>
            Stigmatism surrounding depression can have a major effect on people suffering from it, often leading those who are affected to avoid seeking help. Early intervention is needed to address the stigmas surrounding depression. To do this an understanding of the nature of these stigmas are needed. However, problems are encountered as the current understanding of these stigmas are limited. <br>
            Negative views surrounding depression are common among the public, leading people to believe that people suffering from depression are difficult to talk to, unpredictable and pose a threat to others and often believe that treatment for depression is unnecessary. Researchers have found that people seeking treatment for depression are viewed as being defensive, awkward, insecure, sad and unsociable, often believing that people seeking treatment are more unstable than people that do not seek treatment. <br>
            Approximately 53% of the community believes that others think depression is a sign of weakness and 38% believed others think that people with depression are dangerous. Almost all patients suffering from depression believes that others would see them as lazy or weak. <br>
            Even though depression is stated to be a mental disorder, more in-depth investigation is needed as the believes surrounding depression are different from those surrounding other mental disorders. These differences have major implications for planning anti-stigma programs to help prevent the stigmas surrounding different mental illnesses. <br>
            Concealability in the context of mental illnesses means how obvious the condition is to perceive by others and the how controllable the conditions visibility is. Visibility of the condition can hinder interactions because people with these conditions can often be viewed as ugly or upsetting. People suffering from depression often see the concealability of the condition as a positive, because they can use it to avoid negative responses and consequences.
